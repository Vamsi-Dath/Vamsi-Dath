ABOUT FEEDFORWARD.PY
//

~ Made for MedImg reasearch.

~ Knowledge from various sources is employed into the project. As the field is so new to work with much of the technique used was un-familiar.

~ However base knowledge of the project is acquired during the making.

~ Coded for 10 nodes in the hidden layer of a feed-forward NN. The "num_classes" variable can be set to the nodes required in the hidden layer.

~ MNIST dataset is employed for the training and test sample requirement of the project.
(DATASET containing digital data of handwritten number digits paired with their correct interpretation).

~GPU support as device support is also included so as for the processing of the dataset.
